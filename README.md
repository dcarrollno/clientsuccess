This is an example API client for working with the ClientSuccess CRM
service. This was written to run under Jenkins so non-tech people could
run the job to search for active customers who opted into technical
notifications. The result is a list of emails suitable for attaching
a template email to and sending.

This is for example purposes only as it is somewhat customized for the
platform and company it was written for but may be helpful to others.
